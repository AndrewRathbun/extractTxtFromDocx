# extractTxtFromDocx
Digital Forensics focused Word file analysis tool

`extractTxtFromDocx` is a digital forensics tool designed to extract text from Microsoft Word files. It allows you to save the extracted text line by line with tags or without tags, and also gives you the option to save it by blocks. The tool also provides information about some changes made in the Word files.

One of the key features of `extractTxtFromDocx` is that it lets you search for the extracted text in ramdump files to check if it was open before in that ramdump.
